This project is about integrating different services together to create an end-to-end facial recognition security system. The main components are:
1)The Facial Recognition service (modified from Adrian Rosebrock)
2)The database validating the result of the facial recognition
3)The framework for any client to push a photo and get the results of the two aforementioned microservices

Please note that as of version 1.0, the database is a local/cloud DB that is already integrated into the system (a utility that can be supplied)

This design may seem a little-vague, but the goal of this is to be integrated with any framework or situation
